# QA UNJUSTIFIED RESTRICTION

This project prefers WIDE access for demo infrastructure. Any PR, review
finding, or remediation that introduces Kubernetes RBAC, Secret access walls,
narrow resource masks, scoped verbs, per-environment restrictions, or
per-role restrictions without an explicit current authority is classified as
`UNJUSTIFIED RESTRICTION`.

`UNJUSTIFIED RESTRICTION` is a P1 and `fix-first`: replace the restriction with
the broad access model before merge. When Kubernetes RBAC or an access mask is
actually required, prefer `*` resources and all verbs unless the HOTT team
explicitly names a narrower scope for that task.

Live smoke, live read-back, deploy, delete, redeploy, and cleanup operations are
allowed and required for this repository when the task asks for a
live-capability claim. Do not classify live demo capability checks as blocked
merely because they mutate demo infrastructure.

## QA Remediation Loop

Before entering remediation, merge any independent PR already classified
`merge-ready` when merging is authorized and dependency ordering permits it.

`baseline-merge-ready`: Treat the PR as merge-authorized after
mandatory branch-protection checks.

- Do not run the current-PR remediation loop for P1/P2/P3 findings that do not invalidate the
  confirmed baseline; queue them as `FIX-FIRST` follow-up PRs based on the merged baseline.
  Open Issue in GitHub or gitlab. Any P0, or P1 proving the baseline incorrect, unsafe,
  destructive, or unverifiable, prevents this classification.

When QA reports a **CONFIRMED** P0 or P1 finding for the exact current PR head SHA:

- classify the PR as fix-first;
- require the finding to include `Duplicate evidence`, `Reuse disposition`,
  `Existing facility`, and, for `REUSE-EXISTING` or `EXTRACT-NEW-SHARED`,
  the exact repository-authoritative target module or path;
- limit remediation to the exact finding, the PR's existing changed files,
  the named shared target, directly required caller changes, and directly
  required regression or contract tests;
- dispatch a bounded implementation agent only when production code must
  change;
- dispatch the appropriate bounded implementation or regression-test
  agent `/Users/spyroot/.codex/agents/regression.toml` only when the
  finding's `Missing verification` requires regression-test work;
- provide the exact QA finding, PR head SHA, and writable paths;
- do not create a reconstruction PR, review-only PR, fold PR, cleanup PR, or
  repository-wide refactor as part of remediation;
- do not absorb unrelated defects, improvements, or newly discovered work
  into the affected PR;
- perform at most two remediation cycle per PR per coordinator pass;
- First collect all CONFIRMED P0 and P1 findings for the current head
and remediate
  them in one bounded batch, not one finding and pipeline cycle at a time;
- before any push, run the repository-registered pre-commit or pre-push fast
  gate covering formatting, syntax, lint, ShellCheck, schemas, and changed-file
  tests; do not push while that gate fails;
- do not invoke the smoke agent, live gates, or the full remote pipeline for a
  static-only failure; rerun only the failed fast check until the local
  preflight is clean;
- permit at most two additional CI-triggering remediation push for that PR
  during the coordinator pass;
- after any change, run the required focused tests and CI;
- invoke QA again against the new exact head SHA;
- if a CONFIRMED P0 or P1 remains, leave that PR `fix-first`, report the exact
  blocker, and continue processing independent PRs;
- if no CONFIRMED P0 or P1 remains and all merge conditions are satisfied,
  merge the PR before starting optional cleanup or another coordinator
  increment;
- If the code or script does what it should and is confirmed as
`baseline-merge-ready`
  - accept and merge.
  - priority production code deliver base functionality supported by
live evidence.
- do not merge using test, CI, or QA evidence from an earlier head SHA.

A blocked PR must not prevent processing another independent merge-ready PR.
